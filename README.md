# Traffic-Congestion-Analysis-Using-YOLOv12-and-Quantitative-Metrics-for-Intelligent-Urban-Mobility

Abstract

As urban traffic continues to worsen in 2025, traditional monitoring methods, which are often manual and based solely on vehicle volume, struggle to provide efficient, real-time insights. This research presents an AI-driven traffic monitoring system using YOLOv12, a real-time object detection model, combined with mathematical evaluations like the Speed Performance Index (SPI) and Travel Rate (Trr). Our system processes live CCTV footage to classify various objects such as cars, buses, motorcycles, and even pedestrians, offering a more nuanced understanding of traffic flow. Results show YOLOv12 maintains high detection precision and outperforms its predecessor, YOLOv11, especially in long-term consistency. It accurately identifies congestion triggers beyond just vehicle count, like a slow-moving truck or pedestrian crossing. Despite limitations in low-light conditions and reliance on standard CCTV quality, the system proves scalable and cost-effective, requiring no additional hardware. This research highlights the power of integrating AI and mathematics for smarter, real-time traffic management, moving beyond traditional methods to deliver actionable insights for city planners and policymakers.
